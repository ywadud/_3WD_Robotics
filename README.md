# _3WD_Robotics

Ryerson fall 2016 intro to robotics programming with a 3WD robot

myRobot.py contains forard kinematics, inverse kinematics and turning/rotating functions.

demo_2.py reads and displays the angular velocities of the wheels, ir sensor values and the robot orientation.

demo_3.py implements a motion controller for the 3WD robot using the method of kinematic control.

demo_4.py implements a control strategy for the 3WD robot to do simple obstacle avoidance while navigating to a goal position.

The files manual_F2016.pdf and Exp4_Revised.pdf further explain the mathematics and theory behind the codes.

Robot_Maple_Library.zip allows you to emulate the 3WD robot in Maple (maplesoft software) without needing to have the actual robot.
(Note that I have not tested the code to work with Maple)
